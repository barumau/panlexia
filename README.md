## Let's work together!

Panlexia is a collaborative project. You can help in many ways:

- Improve the documentation.
   - Edit text so that it's easier to understand.
     The documentation is aimed for common people with a basic education.
 	 If you don't understand something, the problem is probably in the text, not in you!
   - Correct mistakes when you spot them.
- Translate the documentation to new languages.
- Add more content!

The documentation is in plain-text in Markdown formatting.
