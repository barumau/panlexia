# Panlexia

## Contents

Panlexia is a collection of interlinked word lists.
Each language has its own word list file.
The file names consist of a three-letter language code from the ISO 639-3 standard and `.tsv` suffix.
For example, the name of the word list file for English is `eng.tsv` and the one for Mandarin Chinese is `cmn.tsv`.

There can be also other language specific files for storing additional information,
for example phonetic transcription or grammatical information.
The name of a transcription file consists of the three-letter language code, a dash (`-`), the name of the transcription system, and `.tsv` suffix.
For example, the name of IPA pronunciation file for English is `eng-IPA.tsv`
and the name of Pinyin Romanized file for Mandarin Chinese is `cmn-pinyin.tsv`.

If for some reason there is two word lists for one language,
the second and greater ones are suffixed with an underscrore and a number.
For example, `eng_2.tsv` and `eng_2-IPA.tsv`.

Each word list file consists of lines that include an entry identifier, a tab (i.e. character tabulation) and a word or words in the given language.
The entry identifier is a unique code.
The word is the translation of the concept in the language in question.
The entry identifiers link translations in different languages together.

001001sp	I
001001op	me
001002sp	you, thou
001002op	you, thee
```

The repository includes also some Python and shell scripts for generating dictionaries.
