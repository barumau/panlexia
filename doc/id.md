# The concept id

## Introduction

The concept ids are a key ingredient in Panlexia.
They are built so that they give a mini definition of the concept in English or in some established scientific terminology.
Every concept id is made up of the following parts:

- a meaning field: The field of meaning where the concept belongs or the topic that the concept is about.
- a colon (`:`)
- a term: A word or phrase that identifies the concept in the field of meaning.
- a period (`.`)
- a word-class marker: One or several uppercase letters that identify the word class of the concept.

For example, the concept id `Family:father.N` consists of
the field `Family`
the term `father`
and the word-class marker `N`, which stands for noun i.e. a person or a thing.
This mini definition on one hand associates the term *father* to its meaning inside the field of *family*
and separates it from other fields like *religion*, where *father* would refer to a 'male priest'.

## Meaning fields

Below is a preliminary division of meaning fields (from *Loanwords in the World's Languages, a Comparative Handbook*).

1. The physical world
2. Kinship
3. Animals
4. Anatomy
5. Food and drink
6. Clothing and grooming
7. The house
8. Agriculture and vegetation
9. Basic actions and technology
10. Motion
11. Possession
12. Spatial relations
13. Quantity
14. Time
15. Sense perception
16. Emotions and values
17. Cognition
18. Speech and language
19. Social and political relations
20. Warfare and hunting
21. Law
22. Religion and belief
23. Modern world
24. Miscellaneous function words

## Terms

Terms in Panlexia are often in plain English
but, when precision is needed, they may come from specialized terminologies.
For example, the anatomical terms should comply with the standardized English terms in
[Terminologia Anatomica](https://ifaa.unifr.ch/Public/EntryPage/ViewTA98New.html).
By referring to established standards we avoid misunderstandings and inaccuracies that are common in the colloquial language.
In addition this helps everybody to create new identifiers in the proper way.

## Word-classes

- `N`: noun i.e. a thing or a person
- `V`: verb i.e. an action or a process
- `A`: adjective i.e. a property or a quality
- `ADV`: adverb or adverbial
- `NUM`: numeral i.e. a quantity
